# Data_Structures_Algorithms_in_Python

Make the comprehenisve arrangements including original smaples, sample calls and solutions to the exercises. 

## Sample Calls 

The original scripts of the textbook is featured with the scripts interaction that is lacking in most of 
the Python algorithm textbooks. However, it includes quite incomplete sample callers. Readers are hard to 
find how to call them. So I provide the comprehensive sample calls that include complete callers (and 
callees) for easy understanding of the call relationship involved in Algorithms and Data Structures. 

## Solutions

Due to answers and pieces of solutions distributed in everywhere in the web and most of them being very 
incomplete, I try to combine the incomplete answers and solutions together, make some improvement and add 
comparing alternatives to highlight algotithms, functions, methods going around important data structures. 
It also includes independent program for running. All of offerings provide a holistic understanding of 
Python Algorithms. 

## Notes 

Thanks for all the contributions provided by the authors Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, MIchael H. 
Goldwasser and the people contributed on the web at large.
