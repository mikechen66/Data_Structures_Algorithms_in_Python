# Data_Structures_Algorithms_in_Python

Make the comprehenisve arrganements including original smaples, sample calls and solutions to the excercises. 

## Sample Calls 

Since the textbook only includes incomplete sample applications, readers are hard to find how to call them. 
So I provide the sample calls that include complete callers for easy understanding of the data structure and
algorithms. 

## Solutions

Due to solutions distributed in everywhere in the web and most of them being very incomplete, I try to combine 
the incomplete solutions together, make some improvement and add comparing alternatives to highlight algotithms,
functions, methods going around important data structures. I also offer independent programs of program running. 
All of offerings provide a for holisticunderstanding of Python Algorithms. 


## Additional Notes 

Thanks for all the contributions provided in the Github and web.
