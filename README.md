# Data_Structures_Algorithms_in_Python

Make the comprehenisve arrganements including original smaples, sample calls and solutions to the excercises. 

## Sample Calls 

Since the textbook only includes incomplete sample applications, readers are hard to find how to call them. 
So I provide the sample calls that include complete callers for easy understanding of the data structure and
algorithms. 

## Solutions

Due to solutions distributed in everywhere in the web and most of them being very incomplete, I try to combine 
the incomplete solutions together, make some improvement and add comparing alternatives to highlight algotithms,
functions, methods going around important data structures. It also includes independent program for running. 
All of offerings provide a holistic understanding of Python Algorithms. 


## Notes 

Thanks for all the contributions provided by the authors Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, MIchael H. 
Goldwasser and the people in the Github and web.
