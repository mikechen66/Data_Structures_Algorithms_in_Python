"""
Red-Black Tree, invented as symmetric binary B-trees by Rudolf Bayer, modified as Red Black Tree by Leo Guibas and 
Robert Sedgewick. The Cormen red-black tree is based on 2-3 tree (not 2-3-4 tree including 4-nodes) in order to 
simpleify the complexity.  The following script is implemented almost completely based on Introduction to Algorithms 
3rd and 4th edition, Chap 12, 13 and 14 by Cormen et. al in Introduction to Algorithms. 

0. Conception:

A red-black tree is a weak-balanced binary search tree that has five attributes including color, key, left, right 
and p (parent). It basically has the functions including search(), predecesor(),successor(), minimum(), maximum(), 
insert() and insert(). It satisfies the following red-black properties:

1). Every node is either red or black.
2). The root is black.
3). Every leaf (nil) is black.
4). If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5). For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

1.Rotation

1).left_rotate: 

The following three links is marked by double lines are altered. This check is not in the book but needed to avoid. 
With regard to code, swaping between x and y is equivalent to swaping between left and right (for left and right 
rotation). Please see the weblink as follows. 

2).right_rotate: 

The following three links marked by double lines are altered. It is the reverse process of the following left 
rotation. With regard to code(not pseducode), swaping between x and y is equivalent to swaping between left and 
right(for right and left rotation). 

The other Left-Right and Right-Left Rotation is the combination of the above two basic rotations. 

2.Insertion

1).Insertion and Coloring

Insert a node z into the tree T as if it were an ordinary binary search tree, and then color z red.

2).rb_insert_fixup

To enable the tree's properties are preserved, we call an auxiliary procedure rb_insert_FIXUP to re-color nodes 
and perform rotations. It has three cases(or scenarios) whitin its if..esle stmt of while loop pseducode:

if z.p == z.p.p.left
    ...
    if y.color == RED:     # case 1;
    elif z == z.p.right:   # case 2;
    else:                  # case 3;
else(same as then clause with "right" and "left" exchanged):
    ...                    

Please note many red-black tree implementations do not strickly apply with the above rule in the else clause("right" 
and "left" exchanged). Also applied code has a varation on the if..else stmt. 

3.Deletion

The procedure for deleting a node from a red-black tree is based on the TREE_DELETE procedure (Section 12.3). 

1).rb_transplant

Because deleting a node need a process of transplanting, we customize the RB_Transplant subroutine in assisting 
TREE_DELETE implementation. 

2).tree_delete 

While deleting a node z, there are three scenarios including z has no child node, one child node or two children 
nodes. Each scenarios need different treatments that rely on a auxiliary procedure rb_delete_FIXUP. 

3).rb_delete_fixup

rb_delete_FIXUP restore the red-black properties with changing colors and performing rotations. It restores No.1, 
No.2 and No.4 properties mentioned in the above conception. It has 4 cases (or scenarios) within its while loop 
pseducode as follows.

if x == x.p.left:
    ...
    if w.color == RED:                                      case 1;
    elif w.left.color == BLACK and w.right.color == BLACK:  case 2;
    elif w.right.color == BLACK:                            case 3;
    else: (omited in the original book)                     case 4; 
else(same as then clause with "right" and "left" exchanged):
    ...
    (repeated as above)

Please note the above pseducode is a little different with the Python code snippet.
