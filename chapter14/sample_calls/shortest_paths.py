"""

The script is quick abstract because it has a call on the methods of Graph class and chained 
call on the methods of the methods of PriorityQueue-like classes. Therefore, it is hard to 
present a concrete test on the script. 


Due to half instantiation of the original graph.py, user only get the Hexadecimal address as 
conducting "from graph import Graph"

{<graph.Graph.Vertex object at 0x7f62d2c6a210>: 0, <graph.Graph.Vertex object at 0x7f62d2c6a250>: 
3, <graph.Graph.Vertex object at 0x7f62d2c6a290>: 5, <graph.Graph.Vertex object at 0x7f62d2c6a310>: 
8, <graph.Graph.Vertex object at 0x7f62d2c6a2d0>: inf}

Therefore, we use the modified "from graph_direct import graph" to enable human-readable 
output such as "Vertex[v1]: 0"ã€‚

There is a related script named dijkstra_queue.py that can help readers understand what happens 
with adoption of Queue data structure. Please take the scriupt for reference in the same folder.
